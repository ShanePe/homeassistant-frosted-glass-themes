### Immerse yourself in a sleek, modern, and visually captivating Home Assistant experience with the Frosted Glass Theme\!

This theme brings a sophisticated "frosted glass" aesthetic to your dashboard, combining transparency with elegant blurring effects to create a truly unique and contemporary look. Designed for both visual appeal and comfortable usability, the Frosted Glass Theme transforms your Home Assistant interface into a work of art.

**Key Features:**

  * **Distinct Glassy Effect:** Enjoy beautifully rendered transparent and blurred elements that give your cards a dynamic, layered appearance.
  * **Light & Dark Modes:** Seamlessly switch between two meticulously crafted versions to suit your preference or time of day:
      * **Light Version:** A bright and airy design, perfect for a clean, open feel.
      * **Dark Version:** A deep, rich, and comfortable aesthetic that reduces eye strain in low-light conditions.
  * **Modern Aesthetics:** Clean lines, subtle shadows, and carefully chosen color palettes ensure a cohesive and up-to-date look across your entire dashboard.
  * **Enhanced User Experience:** Beyond just looks, the theme is designed to make your Home Assistant interface feel more polished and intuitive.

**Compatibility:**

  * **Requires `card-mod`:** This theme heavily utilizes the power of `card-mod` to achieve its distinctive glassy effects. Please ensure you have `card-mod` installed via HACS for the theme to render correctly.
